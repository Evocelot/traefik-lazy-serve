summary: Middleware that retries requests to a backend service when it is temporarily unavailable, allowing time for scale-from-zero or delayed service startup.
description: |
  LazyServe is a Traefik middleware plugin that introduces retry logic
  for upstream service requests. It is especially useful in serverless
  or scale-to-zero scenarios, where the backend may not be immediately
  available. This middleware retries the request with a specified delay
  and number of attempts before giving up.
testData:
  maxRetries: 2
  retryDelay: 1000 #1s
